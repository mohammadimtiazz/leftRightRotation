# leftRightRotation
Algorithm for rotating an array in both left and right direction.


A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

and 2 right rotation would look like [4,5,1,2,3].
